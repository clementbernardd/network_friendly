# Network-friendly with Reinforcement Learning

Project semester with Jade BONNET

- The aim of this project was to solve a Cache friendly recommendation problem with reinforcement learning.
- First we worked on Q-learning algorithm to find optimal contents to recommend for a Markovian user
- Then, we implemented in PyTorch the Deep Q-learning and Double Q-learning algorithms for function approximation
